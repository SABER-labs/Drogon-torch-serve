# C++ Torch Server
### Serve torch models as rest-api using [Drogon](https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon), example included for resnet18 model for Imagenet.

## Build & Run Instructions
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
./rest_server
```

## Client Instructions
```bash
curl "localhost:8088/classify" -F "image=@images/cat.jpg"
```

## Benchmarking Instructions
```bash
curl "localhost:8088/classify" -F "image=@images/cat.jpg" # Run once to warmup.
wrk -t8 -c100 -d60 -s benchmark/upload.lua "http://localhost:8088/classify" --latency
```
